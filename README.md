# Patrolling operation
Tool integration for a patrolling function based on a differential robot. In order to run the script all the .py files need to be in the same folder. In order to run it just execute `python main.py`. This needs to be executed with a Python 2 interpreter, be careful as Python 3 is becoming the norm...

The script's modules rely heavily on some dependencies. Just installs the ones missing with `pip`. The missing libraries will be printed as an error in case they'r missing. You can also take a look at the source code to see the imports and find out the library names. Note that `foto` within the `query_foto` file, as well as `query_foto` and `movement_script` are the different source files not libraries themselves.
